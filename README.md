# part2

The code is finished.

The function unindent does not follow the lab instruction, but hey, it fulfills its purpose so it's fine. It's efficient.

The indent function utilizes the countChar and removeLeadingSpaces so good stuff. The part where it adds the tabs is weird because it adds spaces based on the number of '{' and '}'. When I run it, the code does what it supposed to do but I thought it was going to return lines with one or two spaces in front instead of long spaces.

Good stuff.
